2. **Health Calculation**: Processes raw data into metrics
3. **UI Updates**: Renders interactive components
4. **User Actions**: Handles clicks, refreshes, navigation
5. **Feedback Loop**: Updates state and shows results

## üìä Functional Components

### Health Score Calculation
```typescript
- Analyzes 6 key stages: Offer Accepted ‚Üí Completion
- Weighted scoring system (different stages have different importance)
- Real-time status tracking (completed, in-progress, started, pending)
- Progress percentage calculation
```

### Chain Strength Assessment
```typescript
- Participant count analysis (30 points per connected user)
- Property count analysis (20 points per linked property)
- Base strength calculation with 100% maximum
- Dynamic status categorization
```

### Performance Grading
```typescript
- A+ (90%+): Excellent performance
- A (80-89%): Very good performance  
- B (70-79%): Good performance
- C (60-69%): Fair performance
- D (50-59%): Needs improvement
- F (<50%): Critical attention required
```
